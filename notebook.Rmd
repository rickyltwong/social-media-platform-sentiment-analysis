## Objective

The goal of this project is to conduct a sentiment analysis of popular keywords and phrases across Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. This analysis aims to uncover and understand public opinions and emotions, providing actionable insights that enable Ignite Digital, a digital marketing agency, to refine their strategies and enhance their service offerings.

## Question 5: Are there notable differences in sentiment and engagement when comparing user-generated content across different regions? How do these differences impact overall sentiment trends? [Geographical Strategy]

Authored by: Ricky Wong

In marketing trend investigations, understanding regional differences in user-generated content is crucial for tailoring strategies to specific markets. Social media users come from diverse regions, and analyzing sentiment and engagement metrics across these regions helps us optimize our marketing efforts.

By examining our dataset, which categorizes user-generated content by sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and includes engagement metrics like likes and retweets, we can identify regional trends. This analysis focuses on North America and Europe to highlight key differences.

Analysis Strategy: 1. We grouped the data by country and sentiment to observe variations. We focused on the top 10 countries by post count, calculating the percentage of each sentiment. 2. We want to focus in North America and Europe, we grouped the top 10 countries into North America and Europe. We then again analyze sentiment distribution within these regions. 3. For each region, identify the top 10 hashtags based on the total number of retweets from posts containing these hashtags.

```{r}
top_sentiment_by_region <- analyze_sentiment_by_region(df)

p1 <- ggplot(top_sentiment_by_region, aes(x = reorder(Country, total_count), y = count, fill = Sentiment_Label)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +

        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "top") +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white")) +
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 1, 1), "cm")) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white")) +

### Results 1

From the analysis, it is observed that the USA has the highest number of posts. Among these posts, approximately 70% express a positive sentiment, which is the highest compared to the other nine countries. In the top 10 countries, North America includes the USA and Canada, while European countries include the UK, France, Germany, and Italy.

```{r}

          scale = c(1.5, 0.1), min.freq = 1, 
          max.words = 200, 
          random.order = FALSE, 
          rot.per = 0.35,colors = brewer.pal(8, "Blues"), main = "Top 3 Hashtags in North America")

          rot.per = 0.35,colors = brewer.pal(8, "Oranges"), main = "Top 3 Hashtags in Europe")
```

### Results 2

We aggregated the data according to the countries belonging to North America and Europe and further analyzed it. We identified the top 10 hashtags by retweets in both regions. For North America, the top hashtags are #cooking, #workfromhome, #productivity, #coding, and so on. For Europe, the leading hashtags are #fitnesschallenge, #familytime, #weekend, and #newbeginnings.

### Insights

Understanding these regional differences allows us to:

-   tailor content to fit the preferences and sentiments of each region, improving engagement and conversion rates. For example, ...
-   use sentiment and hashtag trends to create targeted marketing campaigns, such as leveraging nostalgic content in regions where it performs well. For example, ...

## Question 6: How do the sentiments associated with key marketing terms change over time? Which months have the highest counts of positive and negative sentiments, and what are the trending hashtags during these periods? [Temporal Trend strategy]

top_positive_hashtags <- positive_month_data %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, Hashtags) %>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  summarize(post_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(post_count))

top_negative_hashtags <- negative_month_data %>%

  group_by(word) %>%
  summarize(post_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(post_count))

wordcloud(words = top_positive_hashtags$word, freq = top_positive_hashtags$post_count, 
          scale = c(2, 0.1), min.freq = 1, 
          max.words = 200, 
          random.order = FALSE, 
          rot.per = 0.35, colors = brewer.pal(8, "Blues"), main = paste("Top Hashtags in", max_positive_month, "(Positive)"))

wordcloud(words = top_negative_hashtags$word, freq = top_negative_hashtags$post_count, 
          scale = c(2, 0.1), min.freq = 1, 
          max.words = 200, 
          random.order = FALSE, 
          rot.per = 0.35, colors = brewer.pal(8, "Reds"), main = paste("Top Hashtags in", max_negative_month, "(Negative)"))


```

### Results

From the analysis, we observed that the months with the highest counts of positive and negative sentiments vary. Specifically, January 2023 had the highest count of positive sentiment, while September 2023 had the highest count of negative sentiment.

For the month with the highest positive sentiment, the top hashtags included:

-   #cooking
-   #nature
-   #gaming
-   #fitness

For the month with the highest negative sentiment, the top hashtags included:

-   #highschoolstruggles
-   #highschoolreality
-   #highschoolemotions

This pattern is quite reasonable and understandable. January, being the start of the year, is a time when people tend to stay positive and motivated, setting new goals. On the other hand, September marks the beginning of a new academic year. Adolescents face new challenges and uncertainties, especially those entering high school, which can lead to feelings of pessimism or negativity.

### Insight

Understanding these temporal sentiment trends enables Ignite Digital to tailor their marketing strategies more effectively. For example, promoting wellness and self-improvement content in January or addressing back-to-school anxieties in September can lead to more impactful and timely marketing efforts. By aligningour campaigns with the flow of public sentiment, we can enhance engagement and resonance with our audience.
